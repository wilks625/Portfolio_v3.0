      <p>My name is Stephen and I currently work in the healthcare field as a Physical Therapist Assistant. And while I love what I do, I have always been curious about the tech industry. </p> 
       <p>I am now a student at the University of Richmond coding bootcamp where I will learn to become a full-stack web developer. I am enjoying the new challenge and am excited to continue to learn and eventually, one day, start my career as a software engineer.</p>
