# 20 React: React Portfolio

## Description
This this is an updated portfolio that utilizes React for the front end. It has a Home page, Projects page, and Contact Page, but I was only able to display the home page for now.
The page uses bootstrap and is mobile responsive. If the repo is cloned down, it can be run locally.
